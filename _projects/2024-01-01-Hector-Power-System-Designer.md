In robotic systems, the Power Distribution Board (PDB) plays a crucial role by converting battery voltage into various voltage levels required by different components. Specifically, it provides 3.3V to 5V for microcontrollers or sensors; 19V for personal computers like the NUC, which runs complete operating systems and applications; and it adjusts voltages ranging from 19V to 52V to power motors that facilitate movement and other mechanical operations. Thus, the PDB ensures that each part of the robot receives the appropriate power supply while optimizing energy efficiency and safety, making it an essential link between the battery and the robot's functional modules.
